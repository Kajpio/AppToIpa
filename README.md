# AppToIPaOS

This small script allows you to transform a file .app to .ipa file compatible for sideload to an IOS device.
This script is especially useful for people develloping on Windows and using CodeMagic to install their flutter app on their IOS device.

## Usage

Just lauch the python script in the directory with all the *.app files. It will create a Payload.ipa for each one of them.
